In this project, I have built a news portal application using Laravel PHP, Bootstrap and MySQL :

The front/client side of the application  have the latest breaking news section, the news display section, the latest news section as well as other sections. The footer has the listing of the latest posts, as well as the categories display with the number of posts, count per category. The normal user won't be able to access the admin panel. The writer will be able to access the admin panel but will not be able to access some features like seeing or editing other people's posts. The admin will have full CRUD rights on all the sections of the admin panel. 


Application Features:

    Settings -:
             Admin Can change the client-side display features from the admin dashboard

    Admin can create categories

    Admin can perform CRUD(Create, Read, Update and Delete) on categories

    Admin can perform CRUD(Create, Read, Update and Delete) on news posts

    Admin can perform CRUD(Create, Read, Update and Delete) on video posts

    A writer can perform CRUD on His/Her own posts.

    A writer can perform CRUD(Create, Read, Update and Delete) on the video posts that they made.

    Admin can access all the items on the admin panel.

    The normal User cannot access the admin panel.
